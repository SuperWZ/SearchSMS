# Search SMS

Android app for searching SMS messages by phrase + performing word analytics.

Available on the [Play Store][1].

*This was the first real Android app I ever wrote. It was done a long time ago, mostly in the summer of 2010. The code is novice, outdated, and generally rough around the edges!*

## Installation

This project is set up for [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html). Simply clone the repo and open it up with Android Studio in order to build and run.

## Usage

Type in a phrase to search for, and tap Search! You can optionally narrow it down to specific types of messages to search for (sent vs. received).

On a separate tab, you can tap Analyze to see stats about your texting habits. Backup and Restore aren't yet implemented.

## History

This was the first real Android app I ever wrote, other than a few tutorial apps from the Android Developer site. Tutorials in those early days were so bad, there were actually 3rd party guides to teach you how to use the Android tutorials!

The reason I decided to make this app is because nothing good existed at the time to search your SMS messages, so I figured it was a good place to start. At its peak the app had about 45 active installs, which is tiny, but still more than I expected given that I only told a couple of friends about it!

Sometime in July 2015 the app suddenly started to grow in popularity again, and now in early 2016 it's up to about 500 active installs. This is surprising given that it hasn't been updated in years, but it now has 12 reviews and a 4.6 star rating.

The code is novice, outdated, and generally rough around the edges, but for the first app I ever wrote, I think it came out alright. Given the increasing popularity, I plan to rewrite the app in 2016 and make it more useful.

Note:
All the code here is still in its original form, and hasn't been modified since I wrote it in 2010 -- before my Freshman year of college! I fixed up the spacing a bit so I wouldn't go crazy reading it, but that's it. It was written for Android 2.2 (Froyo).
