# Search SMS

Android application for searching SMS messages by phrase, as well as performing analytics on your texting habits.

*This project was done a long time ago, mostly in the summer of 2011.*

## Installation

This project is set up for Android Studio. Simply clone the repo and open it up with Android Studio if you want to run it. The original version is also available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kac.sms).

## Usage

## History

This was basically the first Android app I ever wrote, besides a few tutorial apps from the Android Developer site. Sort of like [these tutorials](http://developer.android.com/training), but way worse. They were so bad, there were actually 3rd party guides to teach you how to use the Android tutorials.

The reason I wrote it is because nothing good existed at the time to search your SMS messages, so I figured it was a good place to start (as well as good experience). At its peak the app had about 45 active installs, which is tiny, but more than I had expected given that I only told a couple friends about it!

The code is novice, outdated, and generally rough around the edges; but for the first app I ever wrote, I think it came out alright. At least, on some phones. On others, it apparently doesn't work. Oh, well.

Note:
All the code here is in its original form, and hasn't been modified since I wrote it in 2011 -- before my Freshman year of college! I fixed up the spacing a bit so I wouldn't go crazy reading it, but that's it.
