# Search SMS

Android application for searching SMS messages by phrase, as well as performing analytics on your texting habits.

*This project was done a long time ago, mostly in the summer of 2011.*

## Installation

This project is set up for Android Studio. Simply clone the repo and open it up with Android Studio if you want to run it.

TODO: Write usage

## History

This was basically the first Android app I ever wrote, besides a few tutorial apps from the Android Developer site. Sort of like [these tutorials](http://developer.android.com/training), but way worse. They were so bad, there were actually 3rd party guides to teach you how to use the Android tutorials.

Anyway, it's novice, outdated, and generally rough around the edges; but for the first app I ever wrote, I think it came out alright. At least, on some phones. On others, it apparently doesn't work. Oh, well.

Note:
All the code here is in its original form, and hasn't been modified since I wrote it in 2011 -- before my Freshman year of college! I fixed up the spacing a bit so I wouldn't go crazy reading it, but that's it.
